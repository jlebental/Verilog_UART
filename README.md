# Verilog_UART
Basys3 FPGA Verilog UART machine
## Project Description
These verilog modules and constraint file enable a basys3 FPGA board to communicate with a Putty device to demonstrate UART recieving and transmitting of ascii encoded characters delivered by the user through keystrokes on a keyboard uinputted into putty.
## Development Environment
This was developed in Vivado.
